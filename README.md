This is far from my finest work, I've dedicated the minimum amount of time to it in-between robotics / general work and it's incredibly bare-bones as a result. I *think* I demonstrate understanding of the technical elements you're looking for but if I've missed something I'll update it later / show that through other projects

as a side note, if you have any interest looking at the code I've made for robotics I'd love to show it off (even though C++ isn't a language you're super comfortable with I've done some cool stuff).
